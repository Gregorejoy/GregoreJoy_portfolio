So we decided to create an application, Glutfit which will provide access to mange our workouts and diet easly. It has many business verticles will comes under one app and our main moto was to overcome the monopoly of a beggest app in the current market.</p>

                        <p class="mt-4 mb-4">The first step of the design process involved user interviews and desk research to understand how competitors and users behave. I believe it’s important to get this information early on in the process, before having an idea or prototyping.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-5">After analysing this insights, I began to conceptualize the solution, focusing on user flows and wireframe to give me a way to iterate faster through ideas. From this, From this, I went to the production mode, designing the interface considering design principles such as contrast, hierarchy and feedback; brand attributes; user interactions, and the imagistic universe presented as briefing by the case.</p>

                        <p class="mt-4 mb-4">Before starting a product like Glutfit, conducting user interviews is crucial to gain valuable insights into the target audience's needs, preferences, and pain points. The interview sample took into account men and women aged from 18 to 60 with different health activities. The interview took approximately 30 minutes. Here's a structured approach to conducting user interviews:</p>
                        <div class="user-inter">
                            <p>> What are your current fitness goals and challenges?<br />
                                Understanding users' fitness goals provides insights into their motivations for using the product  
                                and helps tailor features to meet their needs.</p>
                            <p>> What fitness activities do you currently engage in, and how often?<br />
                                Learning about users' existing fitness routines helps identify areas where the product can 
                                complement or enhance their current practices.</p>
                            <p>> What motivates you to stay consistent with your fitness routine?<br />
                                Exploring users' motivations for staying consistent with their fitness routine helps identify key 
                                factors that drive engagement and retention.</p>
                            <p>> What features or tools do you find most valuable in a fitness app or program?<br />
                                Gathering feedback on users' preferred features helps prioritize development efforts and ensure 
                                that the product aligns with their expectations.</p>
                            <p>> What challenges or frustrations have you encountered with existing fitness apps or programs?<br />
                                Identifying pain points and challenges with existing solutions helps uncover opportunities for 
                                improvement and differentiation in the market.</p>
